My first android project, it was made for an faculty project for the course Development of Mobile Aplications("Razvoj mobilinih aplikacija"). This project should only be viewed as a proof of concept, not a full-fledged serious project. It demonstrates my idea for a simple and cheap bus tracking application. The system consists of 2 android aplications, one application for the bus driver to transmit his location - and by doing so the location of the bus itself, the second application is for the user to view the desired bus and view the bus departure schedule. The final component of the system is a Firebase real-time database.
